How to run the app:

1) Install all the dependencies specified in the package.json file. This can be done using the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   npm install

3) Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
   npm run build

4) Open the dist directory

5) Open the index.html file located within the dist directory in Visual Studio Code. Then, use the Live Server extension to start a local development server. The extension will usually provide a button or command to start the server (often labeled "Go Live"). This will open the application in your web browser. Live Server will automatically reload the page whenever you make changes to the source code and rebuild the project.
